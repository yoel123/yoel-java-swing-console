i created this tool becuse java dosnt have its own cross platform console window.
its also a good solution for using console programs outside of the java console.

input and output is done whitout system.out.print or scanner with system.in.
its up to the devloper to do input and output. i have my own style you can see
in these projects using my console framework.

----------------------------

to use it simply add the y_console.jar and link it to build path.

y_console.jar has two class:

- yconsole_frame : responsible for the look and feel of the console.
- yconsole_action : responsible for handeling any input.

in these projets i will demonstrate how to use both of them .

also i will create vedio tutorials on how to use this framework.

for any quastions please contact me.
